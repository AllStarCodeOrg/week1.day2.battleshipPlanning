# week1.day2.battleshipPlanning

## Instructions
1. Use this time to plan out how your group will build the MVP for a Battleship Game
    - Remember: you DON’T need to build out a completely functional game
2. You will be creating a game that functions similar to [BattleShip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).
3. Do not worry about advanced graphics, concern yourself with the basic functionality for your MVP.
4. You will only need to create one side of the board which should be a 10x10 grid. When the grid loads it should have 'ships' laid out on in certain positions, which are unknown to the user.
5. When the user clicks on a box, it should change color revealing whether or not it is a 'hit'.
6. Write out your plan (breaking large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones)
    - Write who in your group is responsible for what
    - Be sure to distinguish what features are vital and what are just ‘nice to have’
